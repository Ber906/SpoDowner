# Spodownbeta Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up and run the spodownbeta application, which appears to be a Spotify-related tool for downloading tracks.

## Prerequisites

- Git installed on your system
- Node.js and npm installed on your system

## Automated Setup

We've provided a script that automates the entire setup process:

1. Make the script executable:
   ```
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```
   ./setup.sh
   ```

The script will:
- Clone the repository from GitHub
- Move all contents to your current directory
- Install necessary dependencies
- Start the application

## Manual Setup

If you prefer to set up manually, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Ber906/spodownbeta
